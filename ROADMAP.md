# LeiaGuard Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction and planned features for the LeiaGuard project. It is a living document and may be updated as the project evolves.

## Vision

To provide a secure, user-friendly, and easily deployable WireGuard VPN management solution for individuals and small teams, prioritizing privacy and simplicity.

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)

*   **Improved Internationalization:** Full support for Farsi (RTL layout) and other languages.
*   **Enhanced Admin Dashboard:** More detailed usage statistics, user activity logs (optional, privacy-focused).
*   **Automated WireGuard Server Setup:** Script or guided process for setting up the WireGuard server on various Linux distributions.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA for admin accounts for enhanced security.
*   **Invitation Code Enhancements:** More granular control over invitation code usage (e.g., time-based limits, single-device codes).

## Mid-Term Goals (Next 6-12 Months)

*   **API for Integration:** A well-documented API for third-party integrations and custom frontends.
*   **Multi-Server Support:** Ability to manage WireGuard configurations across multiple VPN servers.
*   **User Self-Service Password Reset:** Secure password reset mechanism without admin intervention (e.g., using recovery codes).
*   **Notifications:** Admin notifications for critical events (e.g., new user registration, failed login attempts).

## Long-Term Goals (12+ Months)

*   **Client Applications:** Develop native desktop and mobile client applications for easier user setup.
*   **Advanced Reporting:** Comprehensive reporting and analytics on VPN usage.
*   **Community Features:** Forum or discussion board integration for user support and community building.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** Allow for custom plugins to extend functionality.
