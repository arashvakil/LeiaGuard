# Admin Guide

This guide provides instructions for managing the WireGuard VPN Management System.

## Managing Invitation Codes

1.  **Access Admin Dashboard** (`/dashboard/admin`)
2.  **Create New Codes** with custom:
    *   Code name (e.g., `FAMILY2024`)
    *   Maximum uses (1-1000)
    *   Expiration period (1-365 days)
    *   Optional description
3.  **Monitor Usage** - View who used each code and when
4.  **Copy Codes** - Easy sharing with family/friends

## User Management

1.  **View All Users** (`/dashboard/admin/users`)
2.  **Monitor Device Counts** - See how many devices each user has
3.  **Enable/Disable Users** - Instantly revoke access
4.  **Track Registration** - See which invitation code was used

## Best Practices

*   **Change default admin password** immediately after deployment
*   **Use descriptive invitation codes** (e.g., `FAMILY2024`, `WORK_TEAM`)
*   **Set appropriate expiration dates** for invitation codes
*   **Monitor user activity** regularly through the admin dashboard
*   **Keep invitation codes private** and share only with intended users
