    question: "What exactly is this 'secret portal' thing?",
    answer:
      "Think of it as a magical tunnel for your internet traffic. It's like having a personal teleporter for your data, but with more encryption and fewer molecular transport accidents."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I become a digital ninja?",
    answer:
      "First, you need a secret code from our wizard (the administrator). Then you register, add your devices, and voil√†! You're now part of our exclusive club of internet shadow warriors."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this actually legal?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! We're just really good at making boring internet infrastructure sound mysterious. It's like calling your car a 'personal transportation pod' - same thing, fancier name."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this to hack the Matrix?",
    answer:
      "While we appreciate your ambition, this is more about protecting your cat videos than overthrowing digital reality. Though your internet traffic will look pretty cool bouncing around our servers."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I break something?",
    answer:
      "Don't worry! Our system is designed to be ninja-proof. The worst you can do is disconnect yourself, which is like a digital time-out. Just reconnect and you're back in stealth mode."
  },
  {
    question: "Why all the mysterious language?",
    answer:
      "Because 'secure internet tunnel' sounds boring, but 'secret portal to digital enlightenment' makes you feel like you're in a sci-fi movie. Same technology, way more fun!"
